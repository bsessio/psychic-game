# Psychic-Game

**Carnac the Magnificent** challenges you to a game of **Guess The Letter**, a game of guesses made by keystroke.

## Instructions
Once on the page, clicking any key will register a guess. There is a random letter, from **A-Z (not case sensitive)**, chosen when you load the page, and every time you win or lose a game.

You have **10 total chances** to guess the right letter. That means a better than 1 in 3 chance on pure chance of guessing the right answer!

**Do note:** almost any key will be counted as a guess, but not all keys are possibly valid guesses. If you strike a key that is not an alphabet letter, you will be counted as guessing wrong. Key press carefully!
