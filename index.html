    <h1>The Psychic Game</h1>

<!-- this should be a random array selection of a letter -->
    <p>Guess what letter I'm thinking of!</p>
<!-- then we need to have a DOM event for keyup, looking for that letter -->

    <p>Wins: <span id="wins">0</span></p>
<!-- keeps track of games ended by guessing the letter -->
    <p>Losses: <span id="losses">0</span></p>
<!-- keep track of games ended by reaching 0 guesses -->
    <p>Guesses Left: <span id="gLeft">10</span></p>
<!-- list remaining guesses from 10, reset game if hits 0 -->

    <p>Your Guesses So Far: <span id="guesses"></span></p>
<!-- each keyup counts as a guess - each keyup should also be displayed so they know what they guessed -->
